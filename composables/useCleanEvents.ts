/**
 * Events Cleanup Composable
 *
 * This composable provides comprehensive functionality to manage event cleanup operations
 * in the Firestore database. It handles both bulk cleanup of old events and individual
 * event deletion with proper authentication, caching, and user feedback.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Bulk cleanup of expired/old events via API endpoint
 * - Individual event deletion with Firestore direct operations
 * - Firebase Authentication integration with token validation
 * - Loading state management for UI feedback
 * - Cache invalidation after operations
 * - Internationalized success/error notifications
 * - Dialog visibility state management
 * - Comprehensive error handling and logging
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```typescript
 * const { loading, cleanEvents, deleteOneEvent, visible } = useCleanEvents();
 *
 * // Bulk cleanup old events
 * await cleanEvents();
 *
 * // Delete specific event
 * await deleteOneEvent('event-id-123');
 * ```
 *
 * @author GitHub Copilot
 * @version 1.0.0

   * Performs bulk cleanup of old/expired events
   *
   * This function initiates a server-side cleanup operation that removes
   * events based on predefined criteria (e.g., events older than a certain date).
   * The actual cleanup logic is handled by the '/api/events/clean' endpoint.
   *
   * Process Flow:
   * 1. Validates user authentication
   * 2. Obtains fresh authentication token
   * 3. Makes secure API request to cleanup endpoint
   * 4. Handles response and provides user feedback
   * 5. Manages loading states throughout the process
   *
   * Error Handling:
   * - Displays translated error messages via toast notifications
   * - Logs errors to console for debugging
   * - Throws standardized errors for upstream handling
   *
   * @async
   * @function cleanEvents
   * @returns {Promise<{ success: boolean; deleted: number } | void>} Cleanup result or void on error
   * @throws {Error} When authentication fails or server encounters errors
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const { cleanEvents, loading } = useCleanEvents();
   *
   * // Button click handler
   * const handleCleanup = async () => {
   *   try {
   *     const result = await cleanEvents();

   *       console.log(`Cleanup completed successfully: ${result.deleted} events deleted`);
