/**
 * Future Enhancement Considerations:
 *
 * 1. Loading States:
 *    - Could add a loading overlay during upload process
 *    - Progress indicators for large file uploads
 *
 * 2. Error Handling:
 *    - Global error boundary for upload failures
 *    - Toast notifications for upload status
 *
 * 3. Navigation:
 *    - Breadcrumb navigation for better UX
 *    - Confirmation dialog for unsaved changes
 *
 * 4. Accessibility:
 *    - Focus management for upload completion
 *    - Screen reader announcements for upload status
 *
 * 5. Analytics:
 *    - Track upload success/failure rates
 *    - Monitor file size and processing times

  <!--
    Main Page Container
    
    Provides the primary layout structure for the new songs upload page.
    Uses responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS for optimal
    display across different device sizes.
    
    Layout Breakdown:
    - w-5/6: Takes 83.33% of viewport width for optimal content display
    - mx-auto: Centers the content horizontally
    - mt-8: Adds top margin for proper spacing from header
    - flex flex-col: Vertical layout for page sections
    - gap-y-8: Consistent vertical spacing between major sections
  -->
  <main class="w-5/6 mx-auto mt-8 flex flex-col gap-y-8">
    <!--
      Page Header Section
      
      Contains the page title and primary navigation actions.
      Uses the ViewHeader component for consistent styling and behavior
      across the application.
      
      Components:
      - ViewHeader: Provides consistent page header layout
      - Button: Navigation control for returning to previous page
    -->
    <ViewHeader :title="t('newSongs.pageTitle')">
      <!--
        Back Navigation Button
        
        Provides users with a way to return to the previous page.
        Uses Vue Router's back() method for natural navigation flow.

        - Internationalized label for accessibility
        - Left arrow icon for clear visual indication

        variant="outlined"
        size="small"
        @click="$router.back()"
      />
    </ViewHeader>

    <!--
      Upload Section Container
      
      Provides a centered, card-based container for the CSV upload functionality.
      The card design helps focus user attention on the upload task and
      provides visual separation from other page elements.
      
      Styling Breakdown:
      - card: PrimeVue card styling with elevation and borders
      - mt-4: Top margin for separation from header
      - w-3/6: Takes 50% width for focused upload interface
      - mx-auto: Centers the upload card horizontally
      
      Content:
      - UploadCSV: Main component handling file selection and upload
    -->
    <div class="card mt-4 w-3/6 mx-auto">
      <!--
        CSV Upload Component
        
        The core functionality component that handles:
        - File selection with validation
        - CSV format verification
        - Upload progress indication
        - Success/error feedback
        - Integration with the upload API endpoint
        
        This component encapsulates all the complex upload logic
        and provides a clean interface for users to import songs.
        
        Expected User Flow:
        1. Click to select CSV file
        2. Validate file format and size
        3. Preview data (optional)
        4. Confirm upload operation
        5. Monitor upload progress
        6. Review results and handle any errors
        
        @component UploadCSV

  Styling Notes:
  
  This page uses a minimal, functional design approach:
  
  1. Layout Strategy:
     - Mobile-first responsive design
     - Centered content with generous whitespace
     - Consistent spacing using Tailwind utilities
  
  2. Visual Hierarchy:
     - Clear page title in header
     - Focused upload area with card elevation
     - Subtle color scheme for reduced cognitive load
  
  3. Accessibility Considerations:
     - Semantic HTML structure with main landmark
     - Proper heading hierarchy via ViewHeader
     - Keyboard navigation support through PrimeVue components
     - Internationalized text for screen readers
  
  4. Responsive Behavior:
     - Page width adapts to viewport size (w-5/6)
     - Upload card maintains reasonable proportions (w-3/6)
     - Vertical layout prevents horizontal scrolling
  
  5. Performance:
     - Minimal DOM structure for fast rendering
     - Component-based architecture for code splitting
     - No custom CSS required - relies on utility classes
  
  No scoped styles are needed as the page relies entirely on:
  - Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout and spacing
  - PrimeVue component styling for interactive elements
  - Global theme variables for consistent appearance
